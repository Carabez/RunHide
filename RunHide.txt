Now support for clarion lang.:

As many Clarioneers knows, Clarions 4.x,5.x and 6.x is a win16app creating win32apps...

Copy runhide.exe into the bin dir. of your clarion.

Go to Clarion Main Menu: Project->edit

This will open the window of "Project Editor".
Select Program to Execute from Proyect Tree control

Select runhide.exe (in the bin dir of your clarion app.)

I use the above method in multidll proyect to copy and execute the main exe.

Hope it save a lot of time in your side.

(you can rename runhide.exe to match your main app. name; so you can have multiple configuration.)

Hi there!

Here you have my own personal version of RunHide.exe (original application from Bryan Keadle), that supports an ini file
to get the parameters.

Best Regards.

Sometimes you want to run or distribute a program,
and want to be able to hide the window(s) it creates.

Introducing RunHide.exe,
an utility program that enables you to do just that.

RunHide /?


SYNTAX: RunHide (program) (parameters) (TIMEOUT=seconds) (TERM)

Run any named program as a hidden window.
Programs launched with RunHide should not require any user interaction.
Should the hidden program require any user interaction to continue, 
or pauses due to an error, the program will remain in memory until 
the user logs out of the computer or the computer is rebooted.

To accomodate any potential errors like this,
specify a TIMEOUT value in seconds. 
If after the specified number of seconds,
the launched program has not terminated, it will be forcefully terminated.

If you did not specify a TIMEOUT value,
but you find the program is still running hidden,
you may terminate the program by specifying the TERM option.

For example:

      RunHide MyProgram TERM

This will kill all instances of MYPROGRAM.EXE
